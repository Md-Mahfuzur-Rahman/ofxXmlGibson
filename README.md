ofxXmlGibson
============

ofxXmlGibson has only been tested with mingw on windows with openframeworks 0.7.4 so far and there may be issues with other platforms.  Will update after I've had a chance to test with 0.8 and the MS compilers.

This addon for openframeworks reads animation XML exported from After Effects by the XML Gibson plugin into a handy object oriented interface.  XML Gibson is a script that allows you to export your After Effects compositions to XML files.

Grab the XML Gibson plugin for After Effects here:

This addon includes sample assets and xml in the example:
